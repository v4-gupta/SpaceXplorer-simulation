# SpaceXplorer – C-Based Simulation Project

SpaceXplorer is a C-based simulation project developed during Year 1, focused on
control logic, state-based behaviour, and modular program structure.

The project demonstrates low-level programming concepts such as structured control
flow, separation of concerns, and basic system modelling — foundations relevant to
embedded systems and robotics software.

## Technical Focus
- Control logic and state management
- Modular C program design (.c / .h separation)
- Build configuration using CMake
- Debugging and incremental development

## Build & Run
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./SpaceXplorer

Your repo will:
- Render correctly on GitHub
- Look intentional and engineered
- Be **placement-safe**

This is the difference between “student uploaded code” and “engineering project”.

Once committed, reply **“done”** and I’ll tell you whether to **pin it on your GitHub profile** and how to reference it on LinkedIn without overselling.
