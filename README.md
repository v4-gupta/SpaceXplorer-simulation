# SpaceXplorer – Interactive Simulation Project

SpaceXplorer is an interactive simulation developed during Year 1, designed to explore
control systems, collision handling, and state-based logic.

The project demonstrates structured problem-solving and real-time system behaviour
applicable to robotics and autonomous systems.

## Technical Focus
- Control logic and state management
- Collision detection and physics interactions
- Event-driven system design
- Debugging and iterative development

## Tools & Technologies
- Unity (C#)
- Object-oriented programming
- Physics and collision systems

## Status
Completed (with scope for future extensions)
