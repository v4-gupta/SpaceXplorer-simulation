# SpaceXplorer – C-Based Simulation Project

SpaceXplorer is a C-based simulation project developed during Year 1, focused on
control logic, state-based behaviour, and modular program structure.

The project demonstrates low-level programming concepts such as structured control
flow, separation of concerns, and basic system modelling — foundations relevant to
embedded systems and robotics software.

## Technical Focus
- Control logic and state management
- Modular C program design (.c / .h separation)
- Build configuration using CMake
- Debugging and incremental development

## Build & Run
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./SpaceXplorer
